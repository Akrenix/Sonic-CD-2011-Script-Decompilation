# Sonic-CD-2011-Script-Decompilation

a full decompilation for the scripts in Sonic CD (2011)'s PC port

# THESE ARE FOR USE WITH SONIC CD 2011 (PC VER) ONLY, THEY MOST LIKELY WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL ON THE MOBILE PORTS

- to use these scripts in mods, first extract the scripts folder to the exe's root directory: eg [rootdir]/Scripts/, then make sure the sonic CD mod loader is fully up to date, since the mod loader loads all default scripts from scripts/ so mods are only required to include the scripts that have been changed

- for anyone curious about how TaxReceipt v2 (Sonic CD's scripting language) works, check out the handbook (TaxRecept v2 Handbook.pdf) I made to help get people into using TaxReceipt v2
